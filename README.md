# Chrome Time Tracker Extension 

## Summary
This extension is a simple Chrome extension that will track how long you spend on different sites online.  
The purpose of the extension is to help me learn to use Chrome Extension APIs, handle events in JavaScript, and do some basic data tracking.

## Reason for Implementation
The purpose of creating this sample project was to help me learn how browser-based extensions interact with browser tabs and time-based events.

## Scope
- Track active tab duration
- Track how much time is spent on each website (based on their respective domain name)
- Has a popup that shows the amount of time being tracked

## Limitations
- Data is cleared when the browser is closed and reopened
- Hence, cloud syncing of the data is not yet available (local storage instead)
